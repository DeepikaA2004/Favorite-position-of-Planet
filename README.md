# Favorite-position-of-Planet
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Aman likes to study about planets. Every night he goes outside and observes some planets with his telescope. Then he guesses the distance of each planet and pens it down. In this process, he also penned down his favourite planet position. Given the distance of each planet to be unique you need to return position of Aman's favourite planet after sorting all the distances.

## Input:

N (No of planets)
L (List of distances of the planet)
K (position of Aman's favourite planet in the unsorted list)

## Output:

Position of Aman's favourite planet in the sorted List.

## Example:

## Input
5
[4,5,3,2,1]
2

## Output
5

## Explanation:

The position of Aman's favourite planet in the unsorted list is 2 and the list of distances of planets at position 2 the distance is 5. After sorting the list [1,2,3,4,5] the position of Aman's favourite is changed to 5.
Note: Index is different from position. Indexing of the list starts from 0 whereas positioning in the list starts from 1.
